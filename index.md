# About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer and data scientist passionate about make an impact in financial technology and data science. I completed the Graduate Certificate Program in Data Science at Harvard Extension School in 2021. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies in statistics and economics at the University of California, Berkeley in 2018. During my final undergraduate term, I studied abroad at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

I'm also a proud first-generation college graduate. My parents fled from Vietnam to the United States as war refugees over 30 years ago and instilled in me a strong work ethic and a passion for learning.
