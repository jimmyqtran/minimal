Ever since I discovered how machine learning can transform financial systems, I've been on a mission to merge data science with fintech. As both an engineer and an educator, I thrive on making complex concepts accessible and impactful. Pursuing my passion further, I'm a part-time graduate student at Stanford University, exploring the frontiers of computer science to stay at the forefront of innovation.

My educational path has been a coast-to-coast adventure—and even crossed the Atlantic. After immersing myself in statistics and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, I expanded my global perspective by studying abroad at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Eager to deepen my expertise in data-driven technologies, I completed a Graduate Certificate in Data Science at Harvard Extension School in 2021. 

As a proud first-generation, low-income (FLI) college graduate, my story is deeply rooted in resilience and aspiration. Over 30 years ago, my parents fled Vietnam as war refugees, seeking a new beginning in the United States. The courage they've shown on their journey continues to inspire me to push boundaries and strive for excellence in all that I do.

When I'm not delving into algorithms or teaching, you can find me exploring the rich world of espresso. My favorite spot for coffee beans is [Andytown Coffee Roasters](https://www.andytownsf.com/).

## Volunteer Experience

### Data Fellow/Data Scientist
**Delta Analytics & CareerVillage.org**  — San Francisco, CA  
*2021*  
Our team at Delta Analytics partnered with CareerVillage.org to enhance the platform’s ability to match students’ career-related questions with professionals, focusing on improving the relevance of email recommendations. Using insights from the occupation dataset we developed in 2020, we analyzed user trends and evaluated the existing recommendation algorithms. Our findings revealed a need for improvements in matching accuracy, and we proposed enhancements using a bag-of-words model. Additionally, we developed comprehensive unit tests to help CareerVillage improve their algorithm’s effectiveness. Our work provided actionable insights and recommendations that CareerVillage prioritized for further implementation.



### Data Fellow/Data Scientist
**Delta Analytics & CareerVillage.org**  — San Francisco, CA  
*2020*  
Our team partnered with CareerVillage.org to help improve their platform's ability to deliver personalized career advice to underserved students. By analyzing user engagement and interaction data, we optimized how career-related questions were categorized and matched with professional responses, helping students receive more relevant guidance. We also developed tools to monitor key platform metrics, enabling CareerVillage to better assess their impact. Throughout the project, we maintained the highest standards of data privacy and confidentiality in line with our agreement with CareerVillage.
