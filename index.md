# About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer and educator passionate about making an impact in data science and financial technology. I completed the Graduate Certificate Program in Data Science at Harvard Extension School in 2021. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies in statistics and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2018. During my final undergraduate term, I studied abroad at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

I'm also a proud first-generation college graduate. My parents fled from Vietnam to the United States as war refugees over 30 years ago and instilled in me a strong work ethic and a passion for learning.

In my spare time, I’m an avid lover of espresso and enjoy supporting local roasters. My favorite spot for coffee beans is [Andytown Coffee Roasters](https://www.andytownsf.com/), where I source my espresso beans.
